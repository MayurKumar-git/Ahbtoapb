# Ahbtoapb
A Verilog HDL based project to build a bridge between AHB and APB buses in the AMBA architecture. 
This project was a part of my Internship course in VLSI Design by Maven Silicon Softech Ltd. 
This was the final project to complete my internship.
The AMBA is a bus architecture that is common in ARM based processors. It has 3 main buses, AHB, APB and ASB.
The main aim of this project is to build a bridge between the Advanced High Performance Bus and Advanced Peripheral Bus.
